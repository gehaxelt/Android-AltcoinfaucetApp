Android-AltcoinfaucetApp
========================

Android App for the website [altcoinfaucet.net](http://altcoinfaucet.net). The website provides an public facing [API](http://api.altcoinfaucet.net) which can be used to retrieve some information about the faucets.

This app provides some information about the faucets, which can be found on the website.

###Requirements

- Minimum Android 2.2 (API Level 8) is required to run the app
- An internet connection (wifi/mobile) is recommended

###Permissions

The app needs two permissions to run correctly:

- INTERNET: Access to the internet to download/update the faucet information
- ACCESS\_NETWORK\_STATE: Check the network state, because updates can only be made with an active internet connection.


###Download

As I do not have a PlayStore Account yet, you have to download the app using this link:
